This library implements low-level bindings for terminfo and termios, and also
provides a more convenient interface (called 'hexes') on top of that. See
http://doy.github.com/rust-term/ for documentation.

If you want to link against the curses terminfo library (instead of the more
limited built-in one), you should set "CURSES=1" in the make invocation.
