color
 - by number, name, rgb
attributes
 - standout, underline, reverse, blink, bold
scroll regions
line drawing
fallbacks for terminals that don't support these capabilities
mouse?
make sure that using this for non-full-screen apps works sanely
- should be able to just initialize a Term object and use it to write with
  colors in a regular program
- for instance, .read() shouldn't try to parse escape sequences if we aren't in
  cbreak mode, and cbreak mode and keypad mode should possibly be tied together
error handling
- probably should be able to initialize the escape code trie with a lot more options, and optionally disable them if the terminfo capability doesn't exist
