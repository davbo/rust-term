for 0.0.1
=========
- should be able to do this stuff on file descriptors other than the currently
  hardcoded stdin/stdout (should have a way to do colored error messages on
  stderr at the very least)
- figure out rustdoc

future
======
- error handling
  - probably should be able to initialize the escape code trie with a lot more
    options, and optionally disable them if the terminfo capability doesn't
    exist
  - some output capabilities can also be emulated if the capability doesn't
    exist
- rgb colors
- line drawing
- scroll regions
- mouse?
